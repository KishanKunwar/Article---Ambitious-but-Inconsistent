# If You’re Ambitious but Inconsistent, You’re Chasing the Wrong Thing

If you’re ambitious but inconsistent, you’re not lazy. You’re probably just chasing the wrong thing.

For a long time, I thought the problem was motivation. Or passion. Or confidence. But the real issue was simpler — and harder to accept.

## Passion Is a Bad Strategy in Tech

We’re told to *“do what you love”* and everything will work out. In reality, passion is emotional, unstable, and unreliable.

Some days you feel excited. Most days the work is repetitive, confusing, or boring.

In **data engineering**, the real work looks like:

- Debugging broken pipelines at odd hours  
- Reading documentation nobody wants to read  
- Fixing edge cases that never show up in demos  
- Re-running jobs because one upstream field changed  

There’s nothing glamorous about that.  
And that’s exactly why passion alone fails.

## Mastery Is Built on Boring Work

The uncomfortable truth is this:

> **Real skill is built in the boring parts.**

AI can generate SQL, Spark code, and DAG templates in seconds.  
What it can’t do reliably is:

- Understand business context  
- Define correct metrics  
- Decide tradeoffs in data models  
- Own production failures  
- Be accountable when numbers are wrong  

That’s where engineers are still needed.  
And that’s where inconsistency kills progress.

## The Real Enemy Isn’t Difficulty — It’s Boredom

Most people don’t quit because things are too hard.  
They quit because things stop being exciting.

They jump stacks.  
Abandon half-built projects.  
Restart from scratch again and again.

The result?

- No depth  
- No credibility  
- No momentum  

**Consistency beats raw ambition every single time.**

## Replace Passion With Responsibility

What actually works isn’t passion.  
It’s **responsibility**.

Responsibility means:

- Being useful  
- Solving real problems  
- Shipping even when you don’t feel like it  
- Becoming someone others can rely on  

Responsibility creates meaning.  
And meaning lasts longer than motivation.

## The Real Skill: Frustration Tolerance

In tech — especially data engineering — the most valuable skill isn’t intelligence.

It’s **frustration tolerance**.

The ability to:

- Sit with confusion  
- Be publicly wrong  
- Debug for hours with no progress  
- Keep going anyway  

Most people quit mentally long before they quit officially.

## What I’m Committing to Do in 2026

This year, I’m keeping it simple:

- Pick **one stack** and commit to it seriously  
- Build **one real project** that solves an actual problem  
- Use AI as a **multiplier, not a crutch** — understand everything it produces  
- **Finish what I start**, even when it’s uncomfortable  
- Repeat this process for **12 months**  

No hacks.  
No shortcuts.  
No chasing motivation.

Just **consistent work, visible output, and proof**.
